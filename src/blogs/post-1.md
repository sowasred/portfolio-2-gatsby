### JAMStack / JavaScript, APIs, and Markup

Developers are making tons of decision while developing the
applications. Selecting the web stack according to your
application needs is one of critical decisions. While some
developers stick with traditional web stacks, some of them
exploring the new ways to make future application efficent, fast
and cost effective.

#### Fast

JAMstack sites are super fast because the HTML is already
generated during deploy time and just served via CDN without any
interference or backend delays.

#### Highly Secured

Everything works via an API and hence there are no database or
security breaches.ith server-side processes abstracted into micro
service APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced and so your
site becomes highly secured.

#### Cheaper & Easier Scalability

JAMstack sites only contain just a few files with minimal sizes
that can be served anywhere. Scaling is a matter of serving those
files somewhere else or via CDNs.

### Mern Stack / MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, Node.js

#### Both Client and Server-side Code in JavaScript

MERN primarily develops web applications that are based on
JavaScript due to which the developer can write code for each
side, such as the server and the client-side as well.

#### Best for High-Traffic and High-Volume Databases

MERN is a great option when dealing with large databases
consisting of non-relational data.
